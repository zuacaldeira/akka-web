\label{sec:day-1}


\paragraph{Problem summary.}
The architecture on Section~\ref{sec:akkaria} describes a system with
\akka actors integrated in a \vaadin web application.
%
Today's story shows a possible implementation of such
integration. It's tasks are:

\begin{enumerate}
  % Preparation
\item Preparation
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Create abstract class AkkaUI\\
    \feature{feature/userUI/akkaUI}{done}
  \item Rename MyUI to WelcomeUI\\
    \feature{feature/userUI/akkaUI}{done}
  \item Make WelcomeUI extend AkkaUI\\
    \feature{feature/userUI/akkaUI}{done}
  \item Create class UserUI extends AkkaUI\\
    \feature{feature/userUI/akkaUI}{done}
  \item Merge akkaUI with userUI\\
    \feature{feature/userUI/akkaUI}{todo}
  \end{enumerate}
  % Specification
\item Specification
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine the communication protocol in form of a session type
    specification\\
    \feature{feature/userUI/specification}{todo}
  \item Determine the client-side projection of the communication
    protocol\\
    \feature{feature/userUI/specification/client}{todo}
  \item Determine the server-side projection of the communication
    protocol\\
    \feature{feature/userUI/specification/server}{todo}
  \end{enumerate}
  % Test and Implementation
\item Test and Implementation
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Create tests that asserts about the behaviour expected by the
    specification, both on client and server sides. This tests should
    verify that:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item All expected messages are received
    \item All messages are processed in the order predefined by the
      session type
    \item If termination is mandatory, assert about termination status
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Create WelcomeMVCActor, a subclass of MVCActor, as a
    static\footnote{Why \code{static}} inner class of WelcomeUI. This
    actor will implement the MVC pattern of this architecture:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement the communication protocol inside the
      \code{onReceive()}, as asynchronously as possible.\footnote{Use
        \code{tell} and \code{forward} actor communication patterns
        and reserve the \code{ask} communication pattern for special
        cases.}
    \item Use a \emph{session type based finite state machine} to
      guide communication dealing with message processing order.
    \item Store incoming messages locally to decide how to proceed and
      react to them when; messages make the fsm to advance in the
      session type performing a state transition
    \item Define server-side business actors as BusinessActors
    \item Implement the server-side projection of the asynchronous
      communication protocol in the \code{onReceive()} method.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
